# `t1-extensive` - Skull-stripping of T1-weighted MR images in MNI standard space

This pipeline performs skull-stripping of T1-weighted MR images in [`Ixi549Space` space](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/99-appendices/08-coordinate-systems.html) using the brain mask (`mask_ICV.nii`) from the [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) software.


## Prerequisites
You need to execute the [`t1-volume` pipeline](http://www.clinica.run/doc/Pipelines/T1_Volume/) from Clinica to run this pipeline. Only the `t1-volume-tissue-segmentation` sub-pipeline ("Tissue segmentation, bias correction and spatial normalization to MNI space" step) needs to be executed.


### Running the pipeline
The pipeline can be run with the following command line:
```{.sourceCode .bash}
clinicadl preprocessing run t1-extensive <caps_directory>
```
where:

- `caps_directory` (str) is the input/output folder containing the results in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction) hierarchy.


### Outputs
Results are stored in the following folder of the
[CAPS hierarchy](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction):
`subjects/sub-<participant_label>/ses-<session_label>/t1_extensive` with the following outputs:

- `<source_file>_space-Ixi549Space_desc-SkullStripped_T1w.nii.gz`: T1w image non-linearly registered to the [`Ixi549Space` space](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/99-appendices/08-coordinate-systems.html) and cropped.
