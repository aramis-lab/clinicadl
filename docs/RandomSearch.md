# `random-search`- Hyperparameters exploration

This functionality trains a random model with hyperparameters sampled from a predefined space. 
The hyperparameter space is defined in a `random_search.json` file that must be manually filled
by the user. Some of its variables are mandatory.

This file contains the fixed values or intervals / sets to sample from.
The sampling function are the following:

- `choice` samples one element from a list,
- `uniform` draws samples from a uniform distribution over the interval [`min`, `max`],
- `exponent` draws `x` from a uniform distribution over the interval [`min`, `max`] and return 10<sup>-x</sup>.
- `randint` returns an integer in [`min`, `max`].

The values of some variables are also `fixed`, meaning that they cannot be sampled and
that they should be given a unique value.

The values of the variables that can be set in `random_search.json` correspond to
the options of the [train function](./Train/Introduction.md) except for the 
**Computational resources**, **Cross-validation arguments** and `output_directory`
that are defined with the commandline arguments.
Some variables were also added to sample the architecture of the network.

## Prerequisites

You need to execute the [`clinicadl tsvtool getlabels`](TSVTools.md#getlabels---extract-labels-specific-to-alzheimers-disease) 
and [`clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`](TSVTools.md#split---single-split-observing-similar-age-and-sex-distributions) commands
prior to running this task to have the correct TSV file organization.
Moreover, there should be a CAPS, obtained running the `t1-linear` pipeline of ClinicaDL.

## Running the task

This task can be run with the following command line:
```Text

- `name` (str) is the name of the output folder containing the experiment.

## Content of `random_search.json`

`random_search.json` must be present in `launch_dir` before running the command.

!!! note "Sampling different modes"
    The mode-dependent variables are used only if the corresponding mode is sampled.

Task-dependent parameters:
- `classification`
  - `label`
  - `selection_threhold`: (float) threshold on the balanced accuracies to compute the 
    [image-level performance](Train/Details.md#image-level-results) if mode is not equal to image. 
    Parts of the image are selected if their balanced accuracy is greater than the threshold
    on the validation set. Sampling function: `uniform`. Default will perform no selection.

## Outputs

Results are stored in the results folder given by `launch_dir`, according to
the following file system:
```
<launch_dir>
    ├── random_search.json  
    └── <name>
```

## Example of setting

In the following we give an example of a `random_search.json` file and 
two possible sets of options that can be sampled from it.

### `random_search.json`

```
{"mode": ["patch", "image"],
"network_task": "classification",

"caps_directory": "/path/to/caps",
"preprocessing": "t1-linear",
"tsv_path": "/path/to/tsv",

"diagnoses": ["AD", "CN"],

"epochs": 100,
"learning_rate": [2, 5],
"wd_bool": [true, false],
"weight_decay": [2, 4],
"dropout": [0, 0.9],

"n_convblocks": [2, 6],
"first_conv_width": [4, 8, 16, 32],
"channels_limit": 64,
"d_reduction": ["MaxPooling", "stride"],
"network_normalization": [null, "BatchNorm"]
"n_conv": [1, 2],
"n_fcblocks": [1, 3]}
```

### Options #1

```
{"mode": "image",
"network_task": "classification",

"caps_directory": "/path/to/caps",
"preprocessing": "t1-linear",
"tsv_path": "/path/to/tsv",

"diagnoses": ["AD", "CN"],
"baseline": False,
"unnormalize": False,
"data_augmentation": False,
"sampler": "random",

"epochs": 100,
"learning_rate": 5.64341e-4,
"wd_bool": True,
"weight_decay": 4.87963e-3,
"patience": 20,
"tolerance": 0,

"accumulation_steps": 1,
"evaluation_steps": 0,

"network_normalization": None
"convolutions": 
    {"conv0": {"in_channels": 1, "out_channels": 8, "n_conv": 2, "d_reduction": "MaxPooling"}, 
    "conv1": {"in_channels": 8, "out_channels": 16, "n_conv": 3, "d_reduction": "MaxPooling"}, 
    "conv2": {"in_channels": 16, "out_channels": 32, "n_conv": 2, "d_reduction": "MaxPooling"}, 
    "conv3": {"in_channels": 32, "out_channels": 64, "n_conv": 1, "d_reduction": "MaxPooling"}, 
    "conv4": {"in_channels": 64, "out_channels": 64, "n_conv": 1, "d_reduction": "MaxPooling"},
  "fc": 
    {"FC0": {"in_features": 16128, "out_features": 180},
    "FC1": {"in_features": 180, "out_features": 2}}, "dropout": 0.06792280327917641}
}
```

In this case weight decay is applied, and the values for the hyperparameters of the 
architecture are the following:
```
"n_convblocks": 5,
"first_conv_width": 8,
"channels_limit": 64,
"d_reduction": "MaxPooling",
"n_fcblocks": 2
```
`n_conv` is sampled independently for each convolutional block, leading to a different
number of layers for each convolutional block, described in the `conv` dictionary.
The number of features in fully-connected layers is computed such as the ratio between
each layer is equal (here 16128 / 180 ≈ 180 / 2).

The scheme of the corresponding architecture is the following:

### Options #2

```
{"mode": "patch",
"network_task": "classification",

"caps_directory": "/path/to/caps",
"preprocessing": "t1-linear",
"tsv_path": "/path/to/tsv",

"diagnoses": ["AD", "CN"],
"baseline": False,
"unnormalize": False,
"data_augmentation": False,
"sampler": "random",

"epochs": 100,
"learning_rate": 7.09740e-3,
"wd_bool": False,
"weight_decay": 4.09832e-4,
"patience": 20,
"tolerance": 0,

"accumulation_steps": 1,
"evaluation_steps": 0,

"network_normalization": None
"convolutions": 
    {"conv0": {"in_channels": 1, "out_channels": 16, "n_conv": 2, "d_reduction": "stride"}, 
    "conv1": {"in_channels": 16, "out_channels": 32, "n_conv": 3, "d_reduction": "stride"}, 
    "conv2": {"in_channels": 32, "out_channels": 64, "n_conv": 2, "d_reduction": "stride"}}
  "fc": 
    {"FC0": {"in_features": 21952, "out_features": 2}}, "dropout": 0.5783296483092104}
}
```

In this case weight decay is **not** applied, and the values for the hyperparameters of the 
architecture are the following:
```
"n_convblocks": 3,
"first_conv_width": 16,
"channels_limit": 64,
"d_reduction": "stride",
"n_fcblocks": 1
```
`n_conv` is sampled independently for each convolutional block, leading to a different
number of layers for each convolutional block, described in the `conv` dictionary.

The scheme of the corresponding architecture is the following:
