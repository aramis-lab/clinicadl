# `extract` - Prepare input data for deep learning with PyTorch

This pipeline prepares images generated by Clinica to be used with the PyTorch deep learning library 
[[Paszke et al., 2019](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9015-pytorch-an-imperative-style-high-performance-deep-learning-library)]. 
Three types of tensors are proposed: 3D images, 3D patches or 2D slices.

Currently, only outputs from the [`t1-linear` pipeline](../Preprocessing) can be processed.

## Prerequisites
<!-- Depending on the type of feature or the type of modality you want to use, you will need to execute either the [`t1-linear` pipeline](../T1_Linear) , the [`t1-volume` pipeline](../T1_Volume) and/or the [`pet-volume` pipeline](../PET_Volume)  prior to running this pipeline. -->

You need to have performed the [`t1-linear` pipeline](../Preprocessing) on your T1-weighted MRI.

## Running the pipeline
The pipeline can be run with the following command line:
```Text
clinicadl extract <caps_directory> <tsv_file> <working_dir> <tensor_format>
```

where:

- `caps_directory` (str) is the folder containing the results of the [`t1-linear` pipeline](../Preprocessing) 
and the output of the present command, both in a [CAPS hierarchy](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction).
- `tsv_file` (str) is the TSV file with subjects/sessions to process.
- `working_dir` (str) is the working directory to save temporary file.
- `tensor_format` (str) is the format of the extracted tensors. 
You can choose between `image` to convert to PyTorch tensor the whole 3D image, 
`patch` to extract 3D patches and `slice` to extract 2D slices from the image.

<!--By default the features are extracted from the cropped image (see the documentation of the [`t1-linear` pipeline](../T1_Linear)). You can deactivate this behaviour with the `--use_uncropped_image` flag.

Pipeline options if you use `patch` extraction:

- `--patch_size`: (int) patch size. Default value: `50`.
- `--stride_size`:  (int) stride size. Default value: `50`.

Pipeline options if you use `slice` extraction:

- `--slice_direction`: (int) slice direction. You can choose between `0` (sagittal plane), `1`(coronal plane) or `2` (axial plane). Default value: `0`.
- `--slice_mode`: (str) slice mode. You can choose between `rgb` (will save the slice in three identical channels) or `single` (will save the slice in a single channel). Default value: `rgb`.-->

!!! note "Regarding the default values"
	When using patch or slice extraction, default values were set according to [[Wen et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694)].

    ```{.sourceCode .bash}
    
    usage: clinicadl extract [-h] [-ps PATCH_SIZE] [-ss STRIDE_SIZE]
                             [-sd SLICE_DIRECTION] [-sm {original,rgb}]
                             [-np NPROC]
                             caps_dir tsv_file working_dir {slice,patch,whole}

    positional arguments:
      caps_dir              Data using CAPS structure.
      tsv_file              TSV file with subjects/sessions to process.
      working_dir           Working directory to save temporary file.
      {slice,patch,whole}   Method used to extract features. Three options:
                            'slice' to get 2D slices from the MRI, 'patch' to get
                            3D volumetric patches or 'whole' to get the complete
                            MRI.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -ps PATCH_SIZE, --patch_size PATCH_SIZE
                            Patch size (only for 'patch' extraction) e.g:
                            --patch_size 50
      -ss STRIDE_SIZE, --stride_size STRIDE_SIZE
                            Stride size (only for 'patch' extraction) e.g.:
                            --stride_size 50
      -sd SLICE_DIRECTION, --slice_direction SLICE_DIRECTION
                            Slice direction (only for 'slice' extraction). Three
                            options: '0' -> Sagittal plane, '1' -> Coronal plane
                            or '2' -> Axial plane
      -sm {original,rgb}, --slice_mode {original,rgb}
                            Slice mode (only for 'slice' extraction). Two options:
                            'original' to save one single channel (intensity),
                            'rgb' to saves three channel (with same intensity).
      -np NPROC, --nproc NPROC
                            Number of cores used for processing
    ```

    More precisely,

    - 3D images

    - 3D patches with patch size of `<patch_size>` and stride size of `<stride_size>`

    - 2D slices in {sagittal | coronal | axial} plane and saved in {three identical channels | a single channel}
