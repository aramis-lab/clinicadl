# `train patch` - Train deep learning networks using 3D patches

This option allows training a network on 3D patches. For more information on patches please refer to [tensor extraction](../Preprocessing/Extract.md).
Three network types can be trained with the `patch` input type:

- `autoencoder`, that trains one autoencoder on all patch locations,
- `cnn`, that trains one CNN on all patch locations,
- `multicnn`, that trains one CNN per patch location.

One architecture is implemented in `clinicadl` for the `patch` mode: 
`Conv4_FC3`, adapted to `t1-linear` pipeline outputs.

!!! info "Adding a custom architecture"
    It is possible to add a custom architecture and train it with `clinicadl`.
    Detailed instructions can be found [here](./Custom.md).

## `train patch autoencoder` - Train autoencoders using 3D patches

The objective of an autoencoder is to learn to reconstruct images given in input while performing a dimension reduction. 

The difference between the input and the output image is given by the mean squared error.
In clinicadl, autoencoders are designed [based on a CNN architecture](./Details.md#autoencoders-construction-from-cnn-architectures). 

### Running the task

Here is the command line to train an autoencoder on `t1-linear` outputs with the predefined architecture of ClinicaDL: 
```
clinicadl train patch autoencoder <caps_directory> t1-linear <tsv_path> <output_directory> Conv4_FC3
```
where mandatory arguments are:

- `caps_directory` (str) is the input folder containing the neuroimaging data in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.
- `tsv_path` (str) is the input folder of a TSV file tree generated by `clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`.
- `output_directory` (str) is the folder where the results are stored.

!!! info "Common options"
    Options that are common to all `train` input and network types can be found in the introduction of 
    [`clinicadl train`](./Introduction.md#running-the-task).

The options specific to this task are the following: 

- `--patch_size` (int) size of the patches in voxels. Default: `50`.
- `--stride_size` (int) length between the centers of successive patches in voxels. Default: `50`.
- `--use_extracted_patches` (bool) if this flag is given, the outputs of `clinicadl extract` are used.
Otherwise, the whole 3D MR volumes are loaded and patches are extracted on-the-fly.
- `--visualization` (bool) if this flag is given, inputs of the train and
the validation sets and their corresponding reconstructions are written in `autoencoder_reconstruction`.
Inputs are reconstructed based on the model that obtained the [best validation loss](./Details.md#model-selection).

### Outputs

The complete output file system is the following (the folder `autoencoder_reconstruction` is created only if the 
flag `--visualization` was given):

`autoencoder_reconstruction` contains the reconstructions of all the patches of the first image of the dataset.
The number of patches `N` depends on the `patch_size` and the `stride_size`.

## `train patch cnn` - Train classification CNN using all 3D patches

The objective of this unique CNN is to learn to predict labels associated to images.
The set of images used corresponds to all the possible patch locations in MR volumes.

The output of the CNN is a vector of size equal to the number of classes in this dataset.
This vector can be preprocessed by the [softmax function](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html) 
to produce a probability for each class. During training, the CNN is optimized according to the cross-entropy loss, 
which becomes null for a subset of images if the CNN outputs 100% probability for the true class of each image of the subset.

### Running the task

Here is the command line to train a single-CNN on `t1-linear` outputs with the predefined architecture of ClinicaDL: 
```
clinicadl train patch cnn <caps_directory> t1-linear <tsv_path> <output_directory> Conv4_FC3
```
where mandatory arguments are:

- `caps_directory` (str) is the input folder containing the neuroimaging data in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.
- `tsv_path` (str) is the input folder of a TSV file tree generated by `clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`.
- `output_directory` (str) is the folder where the results are stored.

!!! info "Common options"
    Options that are common to all `train` input and network types can be found in the introduction of 
    [`clinicadl train`](./Introduction.md#running-the-task).

The options specific to this task are the following:

- `--patch_size` (int) size of the patches in voxels. Default: `50`.
- `--stride_size` (int) length between the centers of successive patches in voxels. Default: `50`.
- `--use_extracted_patches` (bool) if this flag is given, the outputs of `clinicadl extract` are used.
Otherwise, the whole 3D MR volumes are loaded and patches are extracted on-the-fly.
- `--transfer_learning_path` (str) is the path to a result folder (output of `clinicadl train`). 
The best model of this folder will be used to initialize the network as 
explained in the [implementation details](./Details.md#transfer-learning). 
If nothing is given the initialization will be random.
- `--transfer_learning_selection` (str) corresponds to the metric according to which the 
[best model](./Details.md#model-selection) of `transfer_learning_path` will be loaded. 
This argument will only be taken into account if the source network is a CNN. 
Choices are `best_loss` and `best_balanced_accuracy`. Default: `best_balanced_accuracy`.
- `--selection_threshold` (float) threshold on the balanced accuracies to compute the 
[image-level performance](./Details.md#soft-voting). 
Patches are selected if their balanced accuracy is greater than the threshold. Default corresponds to no selection.

!!! note "Level of performance"
    The performance metrics are obtained at two different levels: patch-level and image-level. 
    Patch-level performance corresponds to an evaluation in which all patches are considered to be independent. 
    However it is not the case, and what is more interesting is the evaluation at the image-level, 
    for which the predictions of patch-level were [assembled](./Details.md#soft-voting).

## `train patch multicnn` - Train one classification CNN per patch location

Contrary to the preceding network in which all patch locations were used as input of a unique CNN, with this option
a CNN is trained per patch location. Then the predictions of the CNNs are [assembled](./Details.md#soft-voting) to determine
the label at the image level.

The output of each CNN is a vector of size equals to the number of classes in this dataset.
This vector can be preprocessed by the [softmax function](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html) 
to produce a probability for each class. During training, the CNN is optimized according to the cross-entropy loss, 
which becomes null for a subset of images if the CNN outputs 100% probability for the true class of each image of the subset.

### Running the task

Here is the command line to train a multi-CNN on `t1-linear` outputs with the predefined architecture of ClinicaDL: 
```
clinicadl train patch multicnn <caps_directory> t1-linear <tsv_path> <output_directory> Conv4_FC3
```
where mandatory arguments are:

- `caps_directory` (str) is the input folder containing the neuroimaging data in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.
- `tsv_path` (str) is the input folder of a TSV file tree generated by `clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`.
- `output_directory` (str) is the folder where the results are stored.

</pre>

`models` and `tensorboard_logs` contain one output per CNN trained. 
The number of networks (equal to the number of patches) `N` depends on the `patch_size` and the `stride_size`.

!!! note "Level of performance"
    The performance metrics are obtained at two different levels: patch-level and image-level. 
    Patch-level performance corresponds to the concatenation of the performance metrics of all CNNs. 
    The evaluation at the image-level is obtained by [assembling](./Details.md#soft-voting) the predictions of all the CNNs.
