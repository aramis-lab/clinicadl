# `train image` - Train deep learning networks using whole 3D images

This option allows training a network on whole 3D images (as opposed to 3D patches and 2D slices).
Two network types can be trained with the `image` mode:

- `autoencoder`, that learns to reconstruct the input images,
- `cnn`, that learns to differentiate two labels assigned to input images. 

Two architectures are implemented in `clinicadl` for the `image` mode:

- `Conv5_FC3`, adapted to `t1-linear` pipeline outputs,
- `Conv5_FC3_mni`, adapted to `t1-extensive` pipeline outputs.

!!! info "Adding a custom architecture"
    It is possible to add a custom architecture and train it with `clinicadl`.
    Detailed instructions can be found [here](./Custom.md).

## `train image autoencoder` - Train autoencoders using whole 3D images

The objective of an autoencoder is to learn to reconstruct images given in input while performing a dimension reduction. 

The difference between the input and the output image is given by the mean squared error.
In clinicadl, autoencoders are designed [based on a CNN architecture](./Details.md#autoencoders-construction-from-cnn-architectures). 

### Running the task

Here is the command line to train an autoencoder on `t1-linear` outputs with the predefined architecture of ClinicaDL: 
```
clinicadl train image autoencoder <caps_directory> t1-linear <tsv_path> <output_directory> Conv5_FC3
```
where mandatory arguments are:

- `caps_directory` (str) is the input folder containing the neuroimaging data in a [CAPS](https://aramislab.paris.inria.fr/clinica/docs/public/latest/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.
- `tsv_path` (str) is the input folder of a TSV file tree generated by `clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`.
- `output_directory` (str) is the folder where the results are stored.

!!! info "Common options"
    Options that are common to all `train` input and network types can be found in the introduction of 
    [`clinicadl train`](./Introduction.md#running-the-task).

There is one specific option for this task: 

- `--visualization` (bool) if this flag is given, inputs of the train and
the validation sets and their corresponding reconstructions are written in `autoencoder_reconstruction`.
Inputs are reconstructed based on the model that obtained the [best validation loss](./Details.md#model-selection).

### Outputs

The complete output file system is the following (the folder `autoencoder_reconstruction` is created only if the 
flag `--visualization` was given):

`autoencoder_reconstruction` contains the reconstructions of the first three participants of the dataset.

## `train image cnn` - Train classification CNN using whole 3D images

The objective of a CNN is to learn to predict labels associated to images. 

The output of a CNN is a vector of size equal to the number of classes in this dataset. 
This vector can be preprocessed by the [softmax function](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.Softmax.html) 
to produce a probability for each class. 
During training, the CNN is optimized according to the cross-entropy loss. 
Its value becomes null for a subset of images if the probability of the CNN is 1, 
with respect to the true class (ground truth) of each image in the subset.

### Running the task

Here is the command line to train a CNN on `t1-linear` outputs with the predefined architecture of ClinicaDL: 
```
clinicadl train image autoencoder <caps_directory> t1-linear <tsv_path> <output_directory> Conv5_FC3
```
where mandatory arguments are:

- `caps_directory` (str) is the input folder containing the neuroimaging data in a [CAPS](https://aramislab.paris.inria.fr/clinica/docs/public/latest/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.
- `tsv_path` (str) is the input folder of a TSV file tree generated by `clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`.
- `output_directory` (str) is the folder where the results are stored.

!!! info "Common options"
    Options that are common to all `train` input and network types can be found in the introduction of 
    [`clinicadl train`](./Introduction.md#running-the-task).

The options specific to this task are the following:

- `--transfer_learning_path` (str) is the path to a result folder (output of `clinicadl train`). 
The best model of this folder will be used to initialize the network as 
explained in the [implementation details](./Details.md#transfer-learning). 
If nothing is given the initialization will be random.
- `--transfer_learning_selection` (str) corresponds to the metric according to which the 
[best model](./Details.md#model-selection) of `transfer_learning_path` will be loaded. 
This argument will only be taken into account if the source network is a CNN. 
Choices are `best_loss` and `best_balanced_accuracy`. Default: `best_balanced_accuracy`.
