## About the project

This repository hosts the code source for reproducible experiments on
**automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using anatomical MRI
data**.
It allows to train convolutional neural networks (CNN) models.
The journal version of the paper describing this work is available
[here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694).

Automatic classification of AD using a classical machine learning approach can
be performed using the software available here:
<https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-ML>.

> **Disclaimer:** this software is in **going-on development**. Some features can
change between different commits. A stable version is planned to be released
soon. The release v.0.0.1 corresponds to the date of submission of the
publication but in the meanwhile important changes are being done to facilitate
the use of the package.

If you find a problem when use it or if you want to provide us feedback, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/aramis-lab/ad-dl/issues).

## Getting Started
> Full instructions for installation and additional information can be found in
the [user documentation](http://www.clinica.run/clinicadl).

ClinicaDL currently supports macOS and Linux.

We recommend to use `conda` for the installation of ClinicaDL.
It guaranties the right management of libraries depending on common packages:

```{.sourceCode .bash}
conda create --name ClinicaDL python=3.6 pytorch torchvision -c pytorch

conda activate ClinicaDL
git clone git@github.com:aramis-lab/AD-DL.git
cd AD-DL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once done, install the package `clinicadl` as developer in the active conda environment:

```{.sourceCode .bash}
cd clinicadl
pip install -e .
```


## Overview

### How to use `clinicadl` ?

`clinicadl` is an utility to be used with the command line.

There are six kind of tasks that can be performed using the command line:

- **Process tsv files**. ``tsvtool`` includes many functions to get labels from
  BIDS, perform k-fold or single splits, produce demographic analysis of
  extracted labels and reproduce the restrictions made on AIBL and OASIS in the
  original paper.

- **Generate a synthetic dataset.** Useful to obtain synthetic datasets
  frequently used in functional tests.

- **T1 MRI preprocessing.** The `preprocessing` task processes a dataset of T1
  images stored in BIDS format and prepares to extract the tensors (see paper
  for details on the preprocessing). Output is stored using the
  [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.

- **T1 MRI tensor extraction.** The `extract` option allows to create files in
  Pytorch format (`.pt`) with different options: the complete MRI, 2D slices
  and/or 3D patches. This files are also stored in the CAPS hierarchy.

- **Train neural networks.** The `train` task is designed to perform training
  of CNN models using different kind of inputs, e.g., a full MRI (3D-image),
  patches from a MRI (3D-patch), specific regions of a MRI (ROI-based) or
  slices extracted from the MRI (2D-slices). Parameters used during the
  training are configurable. This task allow also to train autoencoders.

- **MRI classification.** The `classify` task uses previously trained models
  to perform the inference of a particular or a set of MRI.

For detailed instructions and options of each task type  `clinica 'task' -h`.

## Examples

### Labels extraction in tsv files

Typical use for `tsvtool getlabels`:

```text
clinicadl tsvtool getlabels <merged_tsv> <missing_mods> <results_path> --restriction_path <restriction_path>
```
where:

  - `<merged_tsv>` is the output file of `clinica iotools merge-tsv` command.
  - `<missing_mods>` is the folder containing the outputs of `clinica iotools missing-mods` command.
  - `<results_path>` is the path to the folder where tsv files are written.
  - `--restriction_path <restriction_path>` is a path to a tsv file containing the list of sessions that should be used.
  This argument is for example the result of a quality check procedure.

By default the extracted labels are only AD and CN, as OASIS database do not include
MCI patients. To include them add `--diagnoses AD CN MCI sMCI pMCI` at the end of the command.

                        iotools merge-tsv.
  missing_mods          Path to the folder where the outputs of clinica
                        iotools missing-mods are.

```
</details>

### Preprocessing
Typical use for `preprocessing` ([ANTs](https://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) software needs to be installed):

```text
clinicadl preprocessing <bids_dir> <caps_dir> <working_dir> --np 32
```
where:

  - `<bids_dir>` is the input folder containing the dataset in a [BIDS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/BIDS/) hierarchy.
  - `<caps_dir>` is the output folder containing the results in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Specifications/) hierarchy.
  - `<working_dir>` is the temporary directory to store pipelines intermediate results.
  - `--np <N>` (optional) is the number of cores used to run in parallel (in the example, 32 cores are used).

If you want to run the pipeline on a subset of your BIDS dataset, you can use
the `-tsv` flag to specify in a TSV file the participants belonging to your
subset.

<details>
<summary>
Here is a description of the arguments present for the preprocessing task.
</summary>

  ```{.sourceCode .bash}
usage: clinicadl preprocessing [-h] [-np NPROC]
                               bids_dir caps_dir tsv_file working_dir

positional arguments:

```
</details>

### Tensor extraction

Once the images are preprocessed they must be converted in tensors. Tensors
consists of `.pt` files that can be loaded with PyTorch.  Using `clinicadl`
these files are stored in a specific folder structure, keeping relevant
information about the original image.  This step can be also run using the
Clinica [`DeepLearning-prepare-data`
pipeline](http://www.clinica.run/doc/Pipelines). Results are equivalent.

### Training a new model

Different kind of networks are trained using `clinicadl train`:

* `image`: uses the full 3D MRIs to train a network.
* `patch`: uses 3D patches (from specific patch size) extracted from the 3D image.
* `roi`: extract a specific 3D region from the MRI.
* `slice`: uses 2D slices to train a CNN.

For each mode, different options are presented, in order to control different
parameters used during the training phase.

### Using a pretrained model
The tool `clinicadl classify` is used to perform the inference step using a
previously trained model on simple/multiple image.

<details>
<summary>
These are the options available for this taskL
</summary>

```{.sourceCode .bash}
usage: clinicadl classify [-h] [-cpu] caps_dir tsv_file model_path output_dir

positional arguments:
  caps_dir         Data using CAPS structure.
  tsv_file         TSV file with subjects/sessions to process.
  model_path       Path to the folder where the model and the json file are
                   stored.

```
</details>

## Testing

Be sure to have the `pytest` library in order to run the test suite.  This test
suite includes unit testing to be launched using the command line.

### Unit testing (WIP)

The CLI (command line interface) part is tested using `pytest`. We are planning
to provide unit tests for the other tasks in the future. If you want to run
successfully the tests maybe you can use a command like this one:

```{.sourceCode .bash}
pytest clinicadl/tests/test_cli.py
```

### Functional testing

Training task are tested using synthetic data created from MRI extracted of the
OASIS dataset.  To run them, go to the test folder and type the following
command in the terminal:

```{.sourceCode .bash}
pytest ./test_train_cnn.py
```
Please, be sure to previously create the right dataset.

### Model prediction tests

For sanity check trivial datasets can be generated to train or test/validate
the predictive models.

The follow command allow you to generate two kinds of synthetic datasets: fully
separable (trivial) or intractable data (IRM with random noise added).

```{.sourceCode .bash}
clinicadl generate {random,trivial} caps_directory tsv_path output_directory
--n_subjects N_SUBJECTS
```
The intractable dataset will be made of noisy versions of the first image of
the tsv file given at
`tsv_path` associated to random labels.

The trivial dataset includes two labels:
- AD corresponding to images with the left half of the brain with lower
  intensities,
- CN corresponding to images with the right half of the brain with lower
  intensities.

## Pretrained models

Some of the pretained model for the CNN networks can be obtained here:
<https://zenodo.org/record/3491003>  

These models were obtained durnig the experiments for publication.
Updated versions of the models will be published soon.
