## ClinicaDL 0.2.2

### Added

- New functionality `clinicadl random-search analysis` to obtain the histogram
  of the balanced accuracy over a random search folder.
- New functionality `clinicadl train from_json` to train a model with
  parameters defined in a JSON file.
- New functionality `clinicadl train resume` to resume a prematurely stopped
  training task.
- Possibility to learn the gray matter intensities with the binary
  classification during training, based on `t1-volume` outputs.
- Refactor code style using Black tool.

### Changed

- Previous `clinicadl random-search` is now `clinicadl random-search generate`
- Cross-validation and computational arguments of `clinicadl random-search
  generate` are now defined in `random_search.json`.
- Remove tensorboardx dependency.

## ClinicaDL 0.2.1

### Added

- the `multi_cohort` flag in train allows to train on several CAPS at the same time.

### Changed

- `clinicadl train roi` now allows any ROI defined by a mask.
- Update README.md to avoid duplicates.
- JSON files are added for `clinicadl classify` and `clinicadl tsvtool getlabels|split|kfold`

### Removed

- Scripts and data related to MedIA publication.


## ClinicaDL 0.2.0

### Added

- New functionality `clinicadl interpret`  to generate saliency maps linked
  to pretrained models based on groups of individual images.
- New functionality `clinicadl random-search` to sample random networks from a
  predefined hyperparameter space.
- Slice subparsers for `autoencoder`/`cnn`/`multicnn` to be homogeneous with other
  parsers.
- roi parser has now `multicnn` option.	
- Add generic options to command line: `--verbose`, `--version` and
  `--logname`.

### Changed

- Behaviour of `clinicadl quality-check t1-volume`.
- Simplify `clinicadl tsvtools` behaviour when using getlabels, split and
  analysis.
- Update documentation.

### Fixed

- Fix broken file when running preprocessing in t1-extensive.
