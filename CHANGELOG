## ClinicaDL 1.0

Welcome in **ClinicaDL 1.0.0** ! 

This is a new version of ClinicaDL with some major changes in the source code. All the main pipelines 
have been refactored. ClinicaDL now used is now working with classes instead of function for easier maintenance 
and better scalability. We introduce in this version our new data structure called MAPS to unify ClinicaDL outputs.

This release also include a major command line refactoring with the introduction of [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/) library.
Major changes in several pipelines command line has been implemented. For instance the preprocessing pipeline has been 
split. Train pipeline has also been refactored to reduce the number of options. The goal is to make ClinicaDL more easy to use, to maintain, 
and adapt the command line to the MAPS.

ClinicaDL aim for more reproducibility: some configuration files are saved in the MAPS to reproduce experiments in the same condition 
(with same environnement and same parameters). In addition we added some options to fix the random processes seed and use Pytorch 
latest enhancement for a deterministic behavior.

Other improvement and small fix have also been implemented.

Be careful this version breaks the backward compatibility with previous versions.

### Added

**Pipelines:**

- New `extract` pipeline to convert nifti images in Pytorch tensors. This pipeline now saves a preprocessing json file 
    with all the information needed for the train pipeline.

**Core:**

- New folder structure: MAPS (Model Analysis and Processing Structure) for ClinicaDL outputs.
- New class MapsManager for MAPS to ease the interface with the MAPS: launch various tasks such as 
    training and prediction, save outputs, read files...
- Other new classes to make ClinicaDL code more scalable: SplitManager, TaskManager, Network...
- Now takes pet-linear images as possible data modality.
- Possibility to fix the seed for a deterministic behavior.

**Other:**

- New arguments for ROI in random search.

### Changed

**Pipelines:**

- `train` pipeline has now a new command line. Please see the doc for more information.
- `train` now accept a TOML configuration file to simplify the command line.
- `train resume` is now named `resume`.
- `random-search generate` is now named `random-search`
- `random-search`now use TOML configuration file instead of JSON.
- `generate` pipeline to generate synthetic dataset (random, trivial and Shepp-Logan).
- `quality-check` pipeline to perform quality check on Clinica t1-linear and t1-volume outputs.

**Core:**

- Major refactoring of the source code repository organization: now ClinicaDL core 
  respects the command line hierarchy as is in Clinica repository.
- Command line: we now use [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/) instead of Argparse.

**Other:**

- Console logs enhancement.
- Replace tensorboardx dependency with torch.utils.tensorboard to remove tensorboardx from requirement.
- GitHub repository name is now ClinicaDL and not AD-DL anymore.
- We will now use [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/aramis-lab/clinicadl/discussions) instead of [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/clinica-user).

### Deprecated

### Removed

**Pipelines:**

- `clinicadl preprocessing` pipelines have been removed. They now have new names (see above).
- `clinicadl preprocessing run` has now completely been removed. Please use Clinica for preprocessing.
- `train_from_json` pipeline has been replaced with TOML configuration file.
- `clinicadl random-search analysis` pipeline has been removed.

**Core:**

- T1-extensive preprocessing is not supported by ClinicaDL anymore.

### Fixed

- Fix multi-class classification.
- Fix classification when only one ROI is given.
- Fix tsvtools when diagnosis column value is not identical to tsv file name.
- Fix `clinicadl tsvtool split` when n_test is 1.
- Fix ROI when user provides 3D tensor for ROI.

### Security

## ClinicaDL 0.2.2

### Added

- New functionality `clinicadl random-search analysis` to obtain the histogram
  of the balanced accuracy over a random search folder.
- New functionality `clinicadl train from_json` to train a model with
  parameters defined in a JSON file.
- New functionality `clinicadl train resume` to resume a prematurely stopped
  training task.
- Possibility to learn the gray matter intensities with the binary
  classification during training, based on `t1-volume` outputs.
- Refactor code style using Black tool.

### Changed

- Previous `clinicadl random-search` is now `clinicadl random-search generate`
- Cross-validation and computational arguments of `clinicadl random-search
  generate` are now defined in `random_search.json`.
- Remove tensorboardx dependency.

## ClinicaDL 0.2.1

### Added

- the `multi_cohort` flag in train allows to train on several CAPS at the same time.

### Changed

- `clinicadl train roi` now allows any ROI defined by a mask.
- Update README.md to avoid duplicates.
- JSON files are added for `clinicadl classify` and `clinicadl tsvtool getlabels|split|kfold`

### Removed

- Scripts and data related to MedIA publication.


## ClinicaDL 0.2.0

### Added

- New functionality `clinicadl interpret`  to generate saliency maps linked
  to pretrained models based on groups of individual images.
- New functionality `clinicadl random-search` to sample random networks from a
  predefined hyperparameter space.
- Slice subparsers for `autoencoder`/`cnn`/`multicnn` to be homogeneous with other
  parsers.
- roi parser has now `multicnn` option.	
- Add generic options to command line: `--verbose`, `--version` and
  `--logname`.

### Changed

- Behaviour of `clinicadl quality-check t1-volume`.
- Simplify `clinicadl tsvtools` behaviour when using getlabels, split and
  analysis.
- Update documentation.

### Fixed

- Fix broken file when running preprocessing in t1-extensive.
